1 Setup Github, Dagshub with dvc accounts with local notebook code & data & pusher to dockerhub
2 Setup github pipeline on push to main builds & pushes to dockerhub a docker image containing latest experiment model from dagshub, & runs it on a simple api end point (a simple index.js suffices)
3 test the built image locally by pulling & running ot from dockerhub
